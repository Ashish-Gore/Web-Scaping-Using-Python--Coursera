## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this Course. All the code base and images, are taken from [Using Python to Access Web Data
 on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?).

*This course shows how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.*
